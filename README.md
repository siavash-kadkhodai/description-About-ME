# description-About-ME
I, Siavash Kodkhodaei, registered on GitHub on October 5, 2022 But on September 1, 2019, I started programming in Java. Until today, I have made several applications in the Android domain and registered several of them in Google Play as a live reference to show my programming level.  My intention of creating this account is to connect with the programmers of the world and help them and also help me.  I intend to immigrate to Canada, so I request all Java and Android programmers in Canada to help me immigrate to this country.  Thank you and wish you good health
